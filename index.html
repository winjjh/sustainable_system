            Place bromothymol blue + water into test tubes The bromothymol blue
            + water mixed liquid becomes acidic with carbon dioxid and turns to

            put aquatic plants in a tube C and wraps the test

            Cover aquatic plants with a plastic bag and experiment to see if
            water escapes through the stomata of aquatic plants and dew form.
            Plants absorb carbon dioxide from sunlight and stomata and water
            from their roots to make glucose and oxygen. This process is called
            photosynthesis.

            produces carbon dioxide, but Plant photosynthesis consumes it. Therefore,
            the amount of human respiration. Therefore, the btb solution changed it color to blue.
            Also, a lot of bubbles are created.

            tube C which is wrapped up with foil preserves its color.
            The tube D which was exposed to the sunlight has changed its color to yellow 
            showing that the auatic plant photosynthesized</p>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>The btb solution is blue when it is basicity, 
            green when it is neutral, 
            and yellow when it is acidic. 
            When you breathe in the btb solution, 
            the carbon dioxide in the breath melts in the water and becomes acidic, 
            resulting in the color of the btb solution turning yellow.
            The color of the yellow solution containing aquatic plants which absorbed carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, 
            changed the color of the solution acidic (yellow) to neutral (green) to basic (blue).
            Same results can be observed with tube B.
